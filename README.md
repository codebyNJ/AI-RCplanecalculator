# PlanCraft.ai

This project is an AI-powered RC plane recommendation tool. It allows users to input key specifications of an RC plane, such as weight, wingspan, and flight time, and generates detailed recommendations for motor type, propeller size, and battery configuration. The recommendations are based on the input provided and are generated using a Hugging Face model.

### AI model used is meta/llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

## Features

- **Input Fields**: Enter specifications like weight, wingspan, and flight time for your RC plane.
- **AI Recommendations**: Get actionable recommendations for motor, propeller size, and battery configuration.
